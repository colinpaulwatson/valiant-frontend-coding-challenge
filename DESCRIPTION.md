TODO: Quick scratch breakdown of your to-dos, how you broke up the different tasks and any QA / tests you did.

# Overview (project broken into major parts):
## Render all the html tags using static data
## Fetch the data and populate the fields
## Calulations and validation
## Apply design/prettify
## Testing

## Notes:
1. Being new to version 3 of Vue, I had to learn using 'ref' variables, and Vue macros in the Composition API on the fly. Room to deepen my knowledge and learning in this area.
2. I have experience writing Jasmine tests, but given time restraints I have not included Vitest or Cypress tests (mainly learning the syntax).
3. Room to improve the error handling when fetching data from json data source. There were no requirements in present scope, but nice to have in the future to show the customer.
4. To ensure my calculations were correct I used the Excel spreadsheet link provided.
